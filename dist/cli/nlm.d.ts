/**
 * nlm — CLI entry point. Composition root for the whole stack.
 *
 * This is the one file that knows about every concrete implementation:
 * SqliteSessionStore (storage), OllamaClient (LLM), Hono (HTTP),
 * McpServer (MCP). Every other module depends on ports. Swapping a
 * backend means editing this file, not anything inside core/.
 *
 * Subcommands:
 *   nlm start    — boot HTTP server on $NLM_PORT (default 3940)
 *   nlm migrate  — run pending migrations against the canonical SQLite
 *   nlm recall   — one-shot recall query from the shell (debugging)
 *   nlm mcp      — run as an MCP stdio server (for ~/.mcp.json wiring)
 *   nlm install  — install the macOS LaunchAgent (auto-start on login)
 *   nlm uninstall — remove the macOS LaunchAgent
